# Doggy-Date

## Overview

Doggy Date is a MERN Stack application (Mongo, Express, React, Node). It was created in with my dog in mind who is a "big dog" trapped in a smaller dogs body. She is rough yet very playful and plays well with larger dogs rather than small dogs. For this reason I created an application where users can create a profile for their furry four legged friends and find local dogs to propose a play date.

## What I Learned

This project solidified my understanding of restful routing and how to create a working backend. It was the smoother part of this project, while React was more of a challenge. With that being said I accomplished my goals with Doggy Dates and learned a lot about Styled Components and how to target specific divs. In the final version of this application I will implement AuthO and use an external API to display dogpark coordinates.
